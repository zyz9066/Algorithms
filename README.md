## Graph Algorithm

### Dijkstrs's Algorithm
Implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm in C++.

### Dominating Set
Little red riding hood is a very competent graph theorist. She has *n* intervals `[l<sub>i</sub>, r<sub>i</sub>]`. She created a *n*
vertex graph where each vertex represents an interval. There is an edge between *u* and *v* if and only if their
corresponding intervals (call them interval *u* and *v*) intersect, i.e. `max(l<sub>v</sub>, l<sub>u</sub>) ≤ min(r<sub>v</sub>, r<sub>u</sub>)`. Now she want you to help her to count the number of Dominating sets in this graph.

Set *S* of vertices of graph *G* is a Dominating set if and only if each vertex *v* of *G* is either a member of *S*
or one of its neighbor is in *S*.

**Input**

Line 1: Integer number *n*, number of intervals.

Lines 2 to n+1: *l<sub>i</sub>* and *r<sub>i</sub>* the start and end point of interval *i*.

**Output**

One integer which is the number of Dominating sets of the graph.
